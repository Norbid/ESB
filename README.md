The rules of the games are:
-dice is thrown multiple times,
-if it's 1 or 2 I'll go one step down,
-if it's 3, 4, or 5, I'll go one step up,
-if it's a 6, I'll throw the dice again and will walk up the resulting number of steps,
-there is a chance of 0.005% of falling down the stairs when I make a move. 
Falling down means that I have to start again from step 0.
